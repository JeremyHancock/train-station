Train Station

Try it out by going here: https://jeremyhancock.github.io/train-station/

This is a simple exercise with Firebase and Moment.js that creates a train schedule that updates with the current time. It also enables a user to add additional trains. I had to disable translation because it causes a visible skip everytime the content reloads. None of the Italian is essential to understanding what's happening.

There are a number of options for future improvement that I hope to make it back to.
1. Put in error messages for missing or incorrectly formated fields when adding trains
2. Order trains in the table by next arrival time
3. Create a button to cancel existing trains
4. Display arrival time over 59 minutes in hh:mm

Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Javascript, Firebase, Moment.js
